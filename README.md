# A. fumigatus Population and Pangenome analysis

These scripts and data are for support of a pangenome project (Lofgren LA et al) on _Aspergillus fumigatus_

It includes steps to 
* align strains and build VCF files for population genomics
* DAPCA analysis of population structure to establish sub-populations
* STRUCTURE and LD_decay analyses to look at mating
* construct _de novo_ genome assemblies, scaffold to a reference genome, and annotate
* OrthoFinder and PIRATE pangenome analysies
* MATing type identification across strains
* Tests for presence of specific alleles associated with antifungal drug resistance

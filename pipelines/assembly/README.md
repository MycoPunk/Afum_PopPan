Assembly was performed on raw reads downloaded from SRA or in new data generated in this project.
The assemblies were first de novo using [AAFTF](https://github.com/stajichlab/AAFTF) which used SPAdes and cleanup steps.

The scaffold step is run by taking the contig assemblies and scaffolding to the Af293 genome.
